# catalogue

This is a tiny script for managing my ebook collection.
When I run the `save_book.py` script, it:

*   Asks me a few questions about the book (title, author, publication date)
*   Moves the file into the same folder as my other ebooks, with consistent naming
*   Adds the metadata to a `metadata.json` file
